# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2020-Labo-Orchestra

## Admin

* **You can work in groups of 2 students**.
* It is up to you if you want to fork this repo, or if you prefer to work in a private repo. However, you have to **use exactly the same directory structure for the validation procedure to work**.
* We expect that you will have more issues and questions than with other labs (because we have a left some questions open on purpose). Please ask your questions on Telegram / Teams, so that everyone in the class can benefit from the discussion.

## Objectives

This lab has 4 objectives:

* The first objective is to **design and implement a simple application protocol on top of UDP**. It will be very similar to the protocol presented during the lecture (where thermometers were publishing temperature events in a multicast group and where a station was listening for these events).

* The second objective is to get familiar with several tools from **the JavaScript ecosystem**. You will implement two simple **Node.js** applications. You will also have to search for and use a couple of **npm modules** (i.e. third-party libraries).

* The third objective is to continue practicing with **Docker**. You will have to create 2 Docker images (they will be very similar to the images presented in class). You will then have to run multiple containers based on these images.

* Last but not least, the fourth objective is to **work with a bit less upfront guidance**, as compared with previous labs. This time, we do not provide a complete webcast to get you started, because we want you to search for information (this is a very important skill that we will increasingly train). Don't worry, we have prepared a fairly detailed list of tasks that will put you on the right track. If you feel a bit overwhelmed at the beginning, make sure to read this document carefully and to find answers to the questions asked in the tables. You will see that the whole thing will become more and more approachable.


## Requirements

In this lab, you will **write 2 small NodeJS applications** and **package them in Docker images**:

* the first app, **Musician**, simulates someone who plays an instrument in an orchestra. When the app is started, it is assigned an instrument (piano, flute, etc.). As long as it is running, every second it will emit a sound (well... simulate the emission of a sound: we are talking about a communication protocol). Of course, the sound depends on the instrument.

* the second app, **Auditor**, simulates someone who listens to the orchestra. This application has two responsibilities. Firstly, it must listen to Musicians and keep track of **active** musicians. A musician is active if it has played a sound during the last 5 seconds. Secondly, it must make this information available to you. Concretely, this means that it should implement a very simple TCP-based protocol.

### Instruments and sounds

The following table gives you the mapping between instruments and sounds. Please **use exactly the same string values** in your code, so that validation procedures can work.

| Instrument | Sound         |
|------------|---------------|
| `piano`    | `ti-ta-ti`    |
| `trumpet`  | `pouet`       |
| `flute`    | `trulu`       |
| `violin`   | `gzi-gzi`     |
| `drum`     | `boum-boum`   |

### TCP-based protocol to be implemented by the Auditor application

* The auditor should include a TCP server and accept connection requests on port 2205.
* After accepting a connection request, the auditor must send a JSON payload containing the list of <u>active</u> musicians, with the following format (it can be a single line, without indentation):

```json
[
  {
  	"uuid" : "aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60",
  	"instrument" : "piano",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:20:50.731Z"
  },
  {
  	"uuid" : "06dbcbeb-c4c8-49ed-ac2a-cd8716cbf2d3",
  	"instrument" : "flute",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:39:03.211Z"
  }
]
```

### What you should be able to do at the end of the lab


You should be able to start an **Auditor** container with the following command:

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 2205:2205 res/auditor
```

You should be able to connect to your **Auditor** container over TCP and see that there is no active musician.

```bash
$ telnet IP_ADDRESS_THAT_DEPENDS_ON_YOUR_SETUP 2205
[]
```

You should then be able to start a first **Musician** container with the following command:

```bash
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
```

After this, you should be able to verify two points. Firstly, if you connect to the TCP interface of your **Auditor** container, you should see that there is now one active musician (you should receive a JSON array with a single element). Secondly, you should be able to use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP datagrams generated by the **Musician** container.

You should then be able to kill the **Musician** container, wait 5 seconds and connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor** container. You should see that there is now no active musician (empty array).

You should then be able to start several **Musician** containers with the following commands:

```bash
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician drum
```
When you connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor**, you should receive an array of musicians that corresponds to your commands. You should also use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP trafic in your system.


## Task 1: design the application architecture and protocols

| #  | Topic |
| --- | --- |
|Question | How can we represent the system in an **architecture diagram**, which gives information both about the Docker containers, the communication protocols and the commands? |
| | ![](./images/diagramme.png) |
|Question | Who is going to **send UDP datagrams** and **when**? |
| | The musician container once it runs at repeated intervals of 2 seconds. |
|Question | Who is going to **listen for UDP datagrams** and what should happen when a datagram is received? |
| | Auditor is going to listen. Auditor should process the datagram and tell what type of instrument the musician is playing. |
|Question | What **payload** should we put in the UDP datagrams? |
| | We put in the payload the JSON structure with all the data needed for the auditor eg.
```json
{
  "instrument":"piano",
  "sound":"ti-ta-ti",
  "activeSince":1593176792034,
  "uuid":"89834efd-5b87-415d-a701-87022bf54006"
}
``` |
|Question | What **data structures** do we need in the UDP sender and receiver? When will we update these data structures? When will we query these data structures? |
| | We will use a **Map** data structure, the sender will use it for sending the correct sound and receiver to update his database with the **uuid**|


## Task 2: implement a "musician" Node.js application

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | --- |
|Question | In a JavaScript program, if we have an object, how can we **serialize it in JSON**? |
|  | We use JSON.stringify global method to serialize our objects. |
|Question | What is **npm**?  |
| | it's the Node js dependency manager (similar to Maven for java) |
|Question | What is the `npm install` command and what is the purpose of the `--save` flag?  |
| | This command will install and add a package dependency to our package.json file, the purpose of the ``--save`` flag' is to explicitly tell npm to add entry to package.jon file, since npm this flag is no longer needed |
|Question | How can we use the `https://www.npmjs.com/` web site?  |
| | We can use this website to search and install nodeJS package with ``npm``  |
|Question | In JavaScript, how can we **generate a UUID** compliant with RFC4122? |
| | We have installed the ``uuid`` package which allow us to generate RFC4122 compliant Unique ID  |
|Question | In Node.js, how can we execute a function on a **periodic** basis? |
| | By using the ``setInterval(func(),time)`` function which execute the function every **time** millisecondes |
|Question | In Node.js, how can we **emit UDP datagrams**? |
| | With the ``dgram`` package (from node library), we can use the ``socket.send()`` method   |
|Question | In Node.js, how can we **access the command line arguments**? |
| | By using the ``process.argv`` object which give us an array  |


## Task 3: package the "musician" app in a Docker image

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | --- |
|Question | How do we **define and build our own Docker image**?|
| | With the ``docker build -t <name> .`` command  |
|Question | How can we use the `ENTRYPOINT` statement in our Dockerfile?  |
| | We can use this statement to define which binary will be launch (default entrypoint is ``/bin/bash -c``)  |
|Question | After building our Docker image, how do we use it to **run containers**?  |
| | With the ``docker run <image> <argument>`` command  |
|Question | How do we get the list of all **running containers**?  |
| | with the ``docker ps`` command  |
|Question | How do we **stop/kill** one running container?  |
| | with the ``docker stop/kill <container name>`` command  |
|Question | How can we check that our running containers are effectively sending UDP datagrams?  |
| | We can use Wireshark to see packet from virtual interface of our container |

## Task 4: implement an "auditor" Node.js application

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | ---  |
|Question | With Node.js, how can we listen for UDP datagrams in a multicast group? |
| | We need to create an UDP socket in listening and add our node to the correct IPv4 multicast group with the ``socket.addMembership()`` method  |
|Question | How can we use the `Map` built-in object introduced in ECMAScript 6 to implement a **dictionary**?  |
| | We can construct a **Map** with ``let myMap = new Map()`` and use ``map.set(k,v)`` method to add entrie to our dictionary  |
|Question | How can we use the `Moment.js` npm module to help us with **date manipulations** and formatting?  |
| | With the different method of the library,  ``moment.now()``  to get the current timestamp and and ``moment.diff(date, 'seconds')``, to get the difference between 2  dates (source : https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/difference/) |
|Question | When and how do we **get rid of inactive players**?  |
| | We have a boolean ``musician.active`` and we iterate periodically to delete inactive musician |
|Question | How do I implement a **simple TCP server** in Node.js?  |
| | By the usage of the ``net`` module in nodeJS we can create a TCPSocket with ``const server = net.createServer((socket)`` source: https://nodejs.org/api/net.html |


## Task 5: package the "auditor" app in a Docker image

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | --- |
|Question | How do we validate that the whole system works, once we have built our Docker image? |
| | We execute the ``validate.sh`` script which will run/kill the musician and check if the auditors update their list correctly |


## Constraints

Please be careful to adhere to the specifications in this document, and in particular

* the Docker image names
* the names of instruments and their sounds
* the TCP PORT number

Also, we have prepared two directories, where you should place your two `Dockerfile` with their dependent files.

Have a look at the `validate.sh` script located in the top-level directory. This script automates part of the validation process for your implementation (it will gradually be expanded with additional operations and assertions). As soon as you start creating your Docker images (i.e. creating your Dockerfiles), you should try to run it.
